Card orders placed in August came to £99,582.82, and Shopify Payments paid £94,396.54 into your bank in August. That's a gap of **£5,186.28**, and every pound of it is accounted for: the bridge below closes with £0.00 left over.

The full report is saved as `files/reconciliation_2026-08.md`, with every order listed. It passed the check that each figure matches the calculation. Here, lists longer than about 20 orders are shown as counts.

## The bridge

| | GBP |
|---|---:|
| Card orders placed in August (Shopify Payments, shipped yet or not) | 99,582.82 |
| − Refunds processed in August | 2,762.41 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;of which on orders from earlier months | 1,093.51 |
| − Card fees | 2,019.03 |
| − Disputes: amount and fees | 223.95 + 45.00 = 268.95 |
| + Adjustments (payout type "adjustment") | 2.35 |
| − Still in transit at month end | 6,075.32 |
| **= Paid out for August's card transactions** | **88,472.41** |
| + Paid out in August for earlier months' transactions | 5,924.13 |
| **= Paid out to the bank in August** | **94,396.54** |

The last line should match the Shopify Payments deposits on your August bank statement. Please check it against the bank.

## Where the money went

- **Timing:** £6,075.32 from late-August sales (87 orders) was still on its way on 31 August and was due in the bank on 1 September. Going the other way, £5,924.13 from late-July transactions (93 of them) reached the bank in August. These two almost cancel out: paid out plus in transit is £94,547.73.
- **Refunds:** £2,762.41 in total. £1,668.90 was on August orders and £1,093.51 on orders from earlier months.
- **Card fees:** £2,019.03. I checked that the fees are consistent across the two files, not that they match the rates in your contract.
- **Disputes (chargebacks):** £268.95 in total:
  - #32603: £41.95 plus a £15.00 fee
  - #32955: £116.00 plus a £15.00 fee
  - #33706: £66.00 plus a £15.00 fee
- **Adjustment:** Shopify credited you £2.35.

## Not in payouts at all

- **PayPal and gift cards:** 180 August orders worth £11,918.00 were paid by PayPal or gift card, so they're not in the £99,582.82 above. Don't look for this money in the Shopify payout report: PayPal money goes to your PayPal balance, and gift cards were paid for when they were sold.
- **Split payments:** 36 orders were paid partly by gift card and partly by card. Only the card part is in the card figures.

## Unmatched items

- **Cancelled order #33431 (£12.95):** it was charged and fully refunded the next day. It's listed rather than netted off.
- **Everything else matched:** every counted order has a card charge, and every charge amount matches its order.

## How this was counted

- **Test orders:** orders tagged "test" or paid through Shopify's test gateway are left out, as your `store_definitions.json` says.
- **Export coverage:** both exports have records on all 31 days of August.
- **Outside check:** the figures come from these exports only. They haven't been compared with any total from Shopify or your bank.

## One question for you

This is the first run, so there's no saved record yet of the values your exports normally contain. Are these all as expected?

- **Payment methods:** Bogus Gateway (for testing), Gift card, PayPal Express Checkout, Shopify Payments
- **Order statuses:** paid, partially_refunded, refunded, voided
- **Shipping statuses:** fulfilled, unfulfilled
- **Tags:** pre-order, test
- **Payout types:** adjustment, charge, dispute, dispute_won, refund
- **Currency:** GBP

The figures above assume these are all normal, and they would change if any of them isn't. If you confirm, I'll save them so that anything new is flagged next month.

# August 2026: card sales vs. money in the bank

**The gap: £5,186.28.** Card orders placed in August came to £99,582.82; Shopify Payments paid £94,396.54 to the bank in August. The bridge below closes to £0.00 unexplained.

Before you read the figures: there's one open question at the end about the export's shape. Until you confirm it, the figures use the values shown under "How this was counted". A different answer would change them.

## Where the money went

- **Timing is the biggest factor.** £6,075.32 from late-August sales was still in transit on 31 August and pays out in early September. Going the other way, £5,924.13 from late-July transactions reached the bank in August. Together, paid out plus in transit is £94,547.73.
- **Refunds:** £2,762.41. Of that, £1,668.90 was on August orders and £1,093.51 was on orders from earlier months.
- **Card fees:** £2,019.03. The script checks that the fees are consistent across the files. It doesn't check them against the rates in your contract.
- **Disputes (chargebacks):** £268.95 in total:
  - #32603: £41.95 + £15.00 fee
  - #32955: £116.00 + £15.00 fee
  - #33706: £66.00 + £15.00 fee
- **Adjustment:** +£2.35 (payout type adjustment).

## Not in payouts at all: paid outside Shopify Payments

180 August orders, £11,918.00 in total, were paid by PayPal or gift card. This money never goes through Shopify Payments payouts, so it won't be in the payout report. PayPal money lands in your PayPal balance. Gift cards were paid for when they were sold.

## Unmatched items

- Orders with no card charge: none
- Charges with no counted order: #33431 (£12.95). This is a cancelled order that was charged and then fully refunded the next day. It's listed here rather than netted off.
- Charges whose amount doesn't match the order: none

## How this was counted

Definitions:
- orders tagged 'test' and orders paid through Shopify's test gateway are left out of sales (your answer)

The export:
- the orders export has records on 31 of 31 days of August 2026
- the orders export's shape is not recorded yet (financial status: paid, partially_refunded, refunded, voided; fulfillment status: fulfilled, unfulfilled; currency: GBP; payment method: Bogus Gateway (for testing), Gift card, PayPal Express Checkout, Shopify Payments; tags: pre-order, test)
- the payout export has records on 31 of 31 days of August 2026
- the payout export's shape is not recorded yet (type: adjustment, charge, dispute, dispute_won, refund; payout status: in_transit, paid; currency: GBP)
- checked against nothing outside the export: give a figure from Shopify or the bank to check it

## Open question for you

The export's shape is not recorded yet: are the payment methods, statuses, tags and currencies listed under "How this was counted" all as expected? If so, they are kept as store_shape.json, and a new one next month is flagged. The figures above assume the values listed are as expected. If any of them isn't, the figures change.
